Motor Controller Communication Protocol
Version 2

This file shows the various commands that can be sent to and received from the motor controller. 
All commands are from the perspective of the computer, so a "Send" command goes from the computer to the Arduino and a receive command goes from Arduino to computer. 
Motor directions (CW/CCW) are from the perspective of looking at the motor top-down. The top of the motor is the side opposite of where the wires come out. 
A command is "repeatable" if it can be programmatically repeated by the Arduino using one of the repeating commands. 

Command	        Send/Receive	Repeatable? 	Function 
r	            Send	        Yes	            Turn rotation motor clockwise
R	            Send	        Yes	            Turn rotation motor counterclockwise
t	            Send	        Yes	            Turn translation motor clockiwse 
T	            Send	        Yes	            Turn translation motor counterclockwise 
c <Command>	    Send	        No	            Continuously repeats the next command until told to stop. Only one command can be continuously repeated at once. 
C	            Send	        No	            Stops all continuously repeating commands.
